# ðŸ¤– Ansible Automation â€“ LAB-IT-UAI

This directory serves as the foundation for managing and deploying the entire infrastructure of **IT-LAB-UAI** using Ansible. The goal is to ensure that every component in the lab â€” from workstations to network configurations â€” can be consistently provisioned, maintained, and reset using automated playbooks.

By leveraging **Ansible**, we ensure:

- **Consistency** across machines and environments.
- **Repeatability** of installations and setups.
- **Idempotency**, meaning playbooks can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
- **Simplicity**, with readable YAML-based playbooks and no need for agents on target machines.

The idea behind this structure is that **everything in the infrastructure should be buildable and recoverable through code**, offering full control and auditability of every stateful change in the LAB.
